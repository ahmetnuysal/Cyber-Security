--- | --- | ---
**Have more than one email address** | Recommended | Consider using a different email address for security-critical communications from trivial mail such as newsletters. This compartmentalization could reduce amount of damage caused by a data breach, and also make it easier to recover a compromised account
**Keep Email Address Private** | Recommended | Do not share your primary email publicly, as mail addresses are often the starting point for most phishing attacks
